# AMS <-> MQTT Bridge

The purpose of this project is to collect information and build a simplified bridge for reading serial DLSM/M-bus information from electrical power meters (AMS), provided over the HAN port, and publishing to some IoT friendly target.

Components will be ESP8622, Arduino code, a (very simplified) M-bus <-> 3.3V serial interface 

The project should include:
* schematics, possibly PCB
* documentation, samples
* arduino library
* ad-hoc testing code
